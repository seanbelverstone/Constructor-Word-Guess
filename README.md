# Constructor-Word-Guess
This is a command-line word guess game! Using node, the user will receive a word all hidden by underscores, much like hangman, and will guess by entering keys. If the letter is in the word, it will show. The user will continue to play until the game states that they've lost (8 incorrect guesses) and it will then prompt them to continue or quit.
